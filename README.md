# 🪨📄✂️ Rock, Paper, Scissors – Python Project

This repository features **two versions** of the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game developed in **Python**. It's one of my **early projects**, showcasing my progress from writing basic game logic to implementing more interactive and feature-rich gameplay.

---

## 🔹 Version 1 – Core Logic Implementation

The first version was my **initial attempt**, where I focused on understanding and building the game step by step. It includes:

- Clear use of **conditional statements** and **user input**
- A basic **player vs. computer** format
- Helped me understand the fundamentals of **game loops**, **randomization**, and **program structure**

## 🔹 Version 2 – Enhanced and Optimized

After completing the first version, I developed a more **optimized and interactive** version using knowledge and inspiration gathered from the **internet** and online programming channels.

### 🆕 Features:
- 🎮 **10-Round Gameplay**: The player competes against a computer bot over 10 rounds
- 🧮 **Point System**:
  - 1 point awarded for a win
  - 0 points for a loss or draw
- 🔢 Tracks total:
  - Player wins
  - Computer wins
  - Tie games
- 🎨 **Emoji Display**: Rock (`🪨`), Paper (`📃`), and Scissors (`✂️`) enhance visual feedback
- 🧹 Cleaner and **more efficient code structure**
- ⚙️ **Improved logic and better user experience**

---

## 💡 What I Learned

- How to break down problems and implement game logic
- Use of **loops**, **functions**, and **conditional logic**
- How to structure code for **readability** and **reusability**
- The value of **iteration**, **self-improvement**, and **learning from online resources**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Modules Used**:
  - `random` – for generating the computer's choice
  - `time` *(optional)* – to add delays for a smoother UX

---

## 📌 Summary

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals and game logic. It marks a key step in my learning journey and demonstrates how practice and continuous improvement can lead to better coding practices.
